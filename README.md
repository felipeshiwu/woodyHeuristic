# woodyHeuristic

The job was to implement a C program that plays Floodit until it reaches the entire board with a single color. 
Some heuristics were made available by the professor, and it was essential to beat floodit_h1 and floodit_h2, 
and provide a solution in up to 5 minutes of execution, using a maximum of 8gb of RAM.
